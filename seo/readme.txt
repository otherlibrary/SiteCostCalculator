How to start:

You need to create a file called db.php (I place it into the folder classes which is one above the root), 

add this code with you database connection parameters:
<?php
define("DB_SERVER", "localhost");
define("DB_NAME", "database");
define ("DB_USER", "user");
define ("DB_PASSWORD", "password");
?>
